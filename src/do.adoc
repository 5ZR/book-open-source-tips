=== Little & often

Steady projects not only look more stable, but are generally more successful & are better for your health. Trying doing a little every week.

=== README

Documentation is usually left to last. At least have a README with some basic information, for example QuickStart.

=== Plan ahead

Create or check tasks today ready for tomorrow. Two benefits of this, allowing you tomorrow to immediately hit the ground running & to digest the tasks overnight as you might make some final tweaks.
