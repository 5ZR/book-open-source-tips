=== Big bang

Dont try to complete the project in a weekend, then ignore it for the next year.


=== Make it public from day 1

I do NOT understand people who say "I will make it public when it is finished". First of all, it will never be finished, secondly you then do not gain all the benefits from Open Source

=== God commits

God or big bang commits are useless & confusing.

=== God Pull Requests

Reviewing god or big bang Pull Requests are not only annoying & painful, but leave room for skimming reviewing & therefore mistakes. A Pull Request should be a single feature. No one ever complained that a Pull Request was too small.
