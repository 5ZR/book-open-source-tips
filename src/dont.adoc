=== Big bang projects

Dont try to complete the project in a manic weekend, then ignore it for the next year. This is not good for your health nor does it look good for your project from the community's view.

=== God commits

God commits or big bang commits are useless & confusing. These are terrible for you & the community for so many reasons.
