[quote, Contributor Covenant, Brief overview of the problem]
Open Source has always been a foundation of the Internet, and with the advent of social open source networks this is more true than ever. But free, libre, and open source projects suffer from a startling lack of diversity, with dramatically low participation by women, people of color, and other marginalized populations.

[quote, Contributor Covenant, Brief overview of the solution]
An easy way to begin addressing this problem is to be overt in our openness, welcoming all people to contribute, and pledging in return to value them as human beings and to foster an atmosphere of kindness, cooperation, and understanding.
