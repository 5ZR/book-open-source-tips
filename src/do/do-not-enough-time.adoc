=== Not enough time

We all have the same 24 hours in a day available to us. It's what you do with it that counts. Try to find a small amount of time per day, even 10 minutes when you are on the toilet - yes you heard me right "on the toilet". Multi tasking in that situation is possible, but trying to work while watching TV is very unproductive.
