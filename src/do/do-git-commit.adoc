=== Git commit

Git commits should be small and atomic, be it a single change or small feature. This will make your commit messages easier to write and and changes will be grouped logically. There are many benefits to this:

* Looking back through the history will be clear & easy to understand
 - if you want to find something
 - undo / remove some work
* Automate the changelog generation as part of your build for tag & package etc
